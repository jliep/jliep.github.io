Hi! I'm Julien, a post-doc working with Christian Hilbe at the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology](http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/social-behaviour). I did my PhD with Jean-Baptiste André, in the Cognitive Science Department of [Ecole Normale Supérieure](https://cognition.ens.fr/en), and Jean-Louis Dessalles, in the Computer Science Department of [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/research/laboratories/information-processing-and-communication-laboratory-ltci). I am originally trained in Mathematics, and have studied (in that order) Economics, International Relations, Social Sciences, and Cognitive Sciences.

I am a game theorist, with a very strong penchant for the social and behavioral sciences. By and large, I try to take a cognitive approach to reputation and cooperation: What information do we need to infer that a partner is trustworthy? Based on what model of the social world can we make this inference? Under what conditions will people evolve to cooperate according to our model of the social world? These are the type of questions that would keep me up all night if I didn't already have a young daughter.

I particularly enjoy interdisciplinary collaborations. I’m always looking to learn new things, and keen to make models that are relevant for non-modelers. I’m also keen to talk with other young or aspiring scientists, and offer my perspective when I can. Feel free to reach out! 

<!--With collaborators from across these disciplines, I have addressed questions such as the function of revenge, or the mechanism through which institutions enable large-scale cooperation.

Recently, I have tried to take a cognitive approach to reputation and cooperation: What information do we need to infer that a partner is trustworthy? Based on what model of the social world can we make this inference? Under what conditions will people evolve to cooperate according to our model of the social world?
